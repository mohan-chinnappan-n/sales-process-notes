## Controlling access to the Opportunity based on particular Opportunity.Stage to non-owner users

#### Use case: Company: ACME computing
- Org-wide-default of Opportunity is *private*
- Likes to introduce new Opportunity Stage called: **Discontinued**
- Likes to provide read-only access to the Opportunities ( to the non-owners) with a restriction: they can see the Opportunities, if they do not own and the Opportunity Stage is NOT **Discontinued**

#### Steps

- Make sure Org-wide-default for Opportunity is private

- Create new item for Opportunity.Stage **Discontinued** with Probability 0%

![Add new Opportunity stage ](./img/adding-oppty-stage-discontinued.png) 

- User Joe Simple *can* see the **Discontinued** Opportunities now:

- Create a criteria based sharing rule for Opportunity to:  provide read-only access to the Opportunities (to non-owners) with a restriction: they can see the Opportunities they do not own and the Opportunity Stage is NOT **Discontinued**
